						<h2>strategic<br>insights</h2>
						<p>
							Portland’s Strategic Insights is a window to the future. Research drives our culture of curiosity to understand the new and influential things in consumerism, design, retail and branding. We also undertake bespoke ethnographic research to reveal the human truths that help us translate insights into compelling customer experiences.<br><br>
							Our insights team organise and facilitate retail safaris in cities around the world to share with our clients international best practice, key trends and ‘flags to the future’. We also facilitate ‘talk shops’. These are master classes designed to help our clients tackle the issues arising from the tectonic shifts that are taking place in retail and customer expectations.
