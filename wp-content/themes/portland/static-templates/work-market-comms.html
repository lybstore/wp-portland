	    				<p>
	    					At Portland we love getting a conversation started, as marketing is now very much a two-way conversation we create engagement and storytelling at every consumer touchpoint.</p>
	    					<p>
									Accessing new audiences through the right tone and channel is essential for the future of marketing. Connecting with people and predicting the next trend we constantly explore new ways to express the brand personality across the whole media universe. Whether it is a brochure, poster, website, ad or app we create a distinct visual voice for the brand. Focusing on the brand positioning we unlock a unique style to enable our clients to convey their message, image and capture brand emotions.</p>
	    					<p>
									As content shifts to small screen building a truly personal relationship has never been more important, we work hard to get
	    						up close and personal, encouraging dialogue and creating lasting relationships.
